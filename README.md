## 🎆 [Neonscape](https://ninjacatz.itch.io/neonscape) ##

<div class="pull_left"><img src="https://github.com/Jill-of-All-Trades/-JAMS-games-/assets/52456404/81f5713c-e727-4b3f-aeaa-42c4b5b0ac41" align="left">

You are a repair robot that awakens in a destroyed **NEON Factory**. A backup copy of the factory AI contacts and informs you that something has happened in the complex, and you need to get to the Mainframe to regain control of it. Use your NEON headlight, magnetic pincers and legs to reach that destination and upload Backup AI to Mainframe.<br>
Game was created during **"Amaze Me Game Jam GMS2"** <br><br>
P.S.: It may be a *little laggy*, cuz we were experimenting with **sprite-stacking technique** (it was hyped at that time).
