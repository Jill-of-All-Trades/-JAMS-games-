You are a repair robot that awakens in a destroyed **NEON Factory**. A backup copy of the factory AI contacts and informs you that something has happened in the complex, and you need to get to the Mainframe to regain control of it. Use your NEON headlight, magnetic pincers and legs to reach that destination and upload Backup AI to Mainframe.<br>
Game was created during **"Amaze Me Game Jam GMS2"** <br><br>
P.S.: It may be a *little laggy*, cuz we were experimenting with **sprite-stacking technique** (it was hyped at that time).

## 🐊 [Quest about... Nothing?](https://ldj.am/$161561) ##

<div class="pull_left"><img src="https://github.com/Jill-of-All-Trades/-JAMS-games-/assets/52456404/d1c7dd01-a8f3-4395-8c6a-a8e56bd8ecc8" align="left">

This time we decided to make a quest game. As always, we added some humor to it. I hope you enjoy this quest, quest about… nothing?

Although I do not think that it is about nothing. After all, doing the same as the characters from this game is quite real…

<br><br>

<br><br>
P.S.: Our 3rd game, and we love it for no reason <3

We decided to introduce you to a small but difficult platformer-style game! You have to play the role of a knight named William and overcome many obstacles on the way to the exit.
<br><br>
*Ludum Dare 44*
<br><br>
P.S.: Our 2nd game, also platformer, but more polished than first game. It's tricky, cuz you should use hurt-things to get forward
